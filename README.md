AR-game.py
You hold your hand/fingers from one edge into the play area. A big red dot is where your hand is. Dodge the small dots as long as you can. If you lose, just press space to restart. 

The command i use to start the game is:
python AR-game.py 0 Right 1

0 is the video capture device

Right or Left decides whether the playing hand should be on the left or right edge.

If the 1 is added, the background is black/white throughout the game, not just after losing it.

image_extractor:
The command i use to use the image extractor:
python ./image_extractor.py ./sample_image.jpg ./result.jpg 600 600

The image SR_NS.jpg is an old painting of mine i made during my art Bachelor.
